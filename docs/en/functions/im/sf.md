# Message Sending and Reading Status in Instant Messaging Applications

Understanding message sending and reading status is an essential part of the user experience in instant messaging applications. This section describes in detail how message status is displayed and functions in both private chats and group chats.

## Private Chat Message Status

In private chats, message sending and reading status are indicated by checkmarks to help users understand whether their messages have been received and read by the recipient.

- **Single Check: Message Successfully Sent**
  - When a user sends a message, a single check appears next to it, indicating the message has been successfully sent to the server.
  - This means the message has reached the recipient's device, but they may not have viewed it yet.

- **Double Check: Message Read**
  - When the recipient opens the chat window and views the message, the single check turns into a double check.
  - This indicates the message has been read by the recipient, confirming they have seen the sent information.

## Group Chat Message Status

In group chats, message reading status is represented by a circular ring icon, allowing users to quickly understand how many group members have read the message.

- **Gray Ring: Message Unread by All**
  - When a message is sent to a group chat, a gray ring appears on its right, indicating that no group members have read the message yet.

- **Partially Green Ring: Message Partially Read**
  - When some group members have read the message, the ring becomes partially green. The green portion represents the proportion of members who have read the message.
  - This provides a visual way for users to intuitively understand the reading progress.

- **Green Ring: Message Read by All**
  - When all group members have read the message, the ring turns completely green.
  - This indicates the message has been read by all participants in the conversation.

- **View Reading Details**
  - By clicking the ring icon, users can view specific lists of members who have and haven't read the message.
  - **Read List**: Shows group members who have viewed the message.
  - **Unread List**: Shows group members who haven't viewed the message yet.

## Status Update Details

- **Real-time Updates**: Message status is updated in real-time based on recipient actions, ensuring senders can quickly understand the reception status.
- **Notification Mechanism**: Users can choose to enable or disable notifications about message read status to balance privacy and information transparency.

The above describes the basic design and functionality of message sending and reading status in instant messaging applications. These status display methods can be further optimized and adjusted based on specific application requirements and user feedback.
